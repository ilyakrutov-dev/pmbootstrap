Welcome to pmbootstrap's documentation!
=======================================

pmboostrap is the central command-line application for postmarketOS development. Among other things,
it allows building packages, creating installation images and flashing themx to your device. If you just want to install 
postmarketOS, read the `Installation`_ wiki article first since you might not need pmbootstrap depeing on the method.

For the latest releases please check the `repository`_. 
  
In case of any problems that is also the place to check the `issue-tracker`_.

For further information, please check out the `postmarketOS-wiki`_.
